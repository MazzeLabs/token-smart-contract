Expansion via Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) | By listing on CEXs, the wrapped MAZZE token reaches a wider investor base, adding liquidity and providing diverse trading options. This step is key to gaining mainstream market exposure.

**Seamless Transition Post-Mainnet** | Post-mainnet, a Ethereum-Mazze bridge will be implemented, allowing the exchange of wrapped MAZZE tokens for native MAZZE tokens. This process is vital for a smooth transition for token holders.

**Supports Mazze's Market Stability** | The multi-faceted approach to the wrapped MAZZE token ensures Mazze maintains a stable market presence during development, enhancing the token's long-term value and utility in the blockchain ecosystem.

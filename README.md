## Utility

- **Facilitates Immediate Liquidity** | The wrapped MAZZE token, launched on an established blockchain, leverages the existing infrastructure to offer immediate liquidity, crucial for the token's early market presence.

- **Token Sale for Development Funding** | The token sale of wrapped MAZZE is instrumental in generating funds for Mazzeâ€™s development and operations. This phase is vital for community building and engaging early adopters.

- **Accessibility on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** | Listing on DEXs like Uniswap enhances the token's accessibility, fostering liquidity and enabling decentralized price discovery. Expansion via Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) | By listing on CEXs, the wrapped MAZZE token reaches a wider investor base, adding liquidity and providing diverse trading options. This step is key to gaining mainstream market exposure.

- **Seamless Transition Post-Mainnet** | Post-mainnet, a Ethereum-Mazze bridge will be implemented, allowing the exchange of wrapped MAZZE tokens for native MAZZE tokens. This process is vital for a smooth transition for token holders.

- **Supports Mazze's Market Stability** | The multi-faceted approach to the wrapped MAZZE token ensures Mazze maintains a stable market presence during development, enhancing the token's long-term value and utility in the blockchain ecosystem.
